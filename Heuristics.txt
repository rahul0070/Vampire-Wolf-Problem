*** 15 TILE SLIDING PUZZLE ***

-> The states are defined as a list of lenght "16". Each value corresponds to the value of the tiles in the 15 sliding tile. 
-> "b" represents the blank state. 
-> There were 12 possible moves for each of the 4 options (up, Down, Left, Right).

-> Let (X1, Y1) be the coordinates of a tile in Start state.
and (X2, Y2) be the coordinates of the respective tile in Goal state.
(** These coordinates are positions corresponding the 15 tile problem)

(** Using either of the following we get the distance a particular tile has to displaced to reach the goal state.)

=> Manhattan distance : Abs(X1 - X2) + Abs(Y1 - Y2)
=> Euclidean distance : Sqrt( Sqr(X1 - X2) + Sqr(X1 - X2))

-> Summing up all the heuristic values (Manhattan/Euclidean distance) of the 15 indvidual tile, we get the heuristic function of the puzzle.

*** VAMPIRE-WEREWOLF PUZZLE ***

-> The states are represented by a list of 5 elements.
[Werewolves_west, Vampires_west, Werewolves_east, Vampires_east, Side].

-> Given the safe states in the problem, I gave condition such that the MOVE always respects these.

-> The heuristic function is the No. of members (Vampires + Werewolves) on the goal side/ size of the boat.
